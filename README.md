## Overview

This is the class repository for STS198.

## Learning Goals:

Introduce the students to data science analysis through case studies
of working with data to develop and tell meaningful stories about
interesting questions.  Learn how to quantify concepts and what
measures to use and not use, when and why.  Understand uncertainty,
sampling variability, inherent biases and limitations of data. Reason
about confounding variables and how to explain/present insights with
data. Contextualize data analysis historically and socially and assess
its power through storytelling.  Gain confidence in exploring data and
identifying potential insights and issues.
