Datasets: Need 7 datasets for class (roughly 1.5 weeks per dataset)

 - Flight delay data: 12M obs, Clean, well-known by Duncan, can subset in interesting ways
 - Craigslist: 22,000+ obs, less clean, timely and relevant
 - 2016 election polls: ~1600 polls at state and national level
 - CollegeScorecard: 132,421 x 1743 - lots here, clean. Includes data on cost, earnings, loans, and repayment.
 - Health care costs: 163,066 x 12 - Costs throughout the US on the top 100 billed procedures

Other ideas:
 - demographic
 - UFO 
 - Armed conflict
 - campaign finance
