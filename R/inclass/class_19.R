# STS 198
# Last class!

# More practice - use pre-data with simple data to practice
# too many data sets - too many elements in the assignments?
# wanted to stay on data for a little long - investigate more
# trade-off between freedom to explore and structure
# writing before code -
# Post-data building off eachother -
# one explore, one story
