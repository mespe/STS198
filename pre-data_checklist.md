## The pre-data worksheet

This is a very basic set of questions that should be asked PRIOR to
starting any investigation of a new dataset. Answering these questions
will help you to avoid mistakes later in the process.

What are the data?
  + How many observations?
  + What are the observational units?
  + How many variables?
  + What units are the variables in?
  + Are the available variables direct measurements of what you are
    interested in? Or are they proxy measurements?
  + What scale are the data on? Are data collected at different times
    or at different locations? 
  + Are the same observational units measured repeatedly?
  + Is there variability in the data? 
  
Scope:
  + Do these data address the question at hand?
  + Are there missing observations, observational units, or other
    important variables? 
  + What are potential biases in the data?
  + Do the data represent an entire population? A sample?
  + How were the data collected?
  
Stakeholders:
  + Who is interested in these data?
  + What are relevant questions to ask?
  + What is "coinvincing" evidence to the stakeholders?
  + What conventions/language/terminology are the stakeholders accustomed to?
