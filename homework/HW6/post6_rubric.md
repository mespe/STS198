# Post-data 6 Rubric

*STS198 Spring 2017*

**Total points: 20**

### Prompt
> PLEASE CHOOSE ONE (AND ONLY ONE) EXPLANATION TO EXPLORE:
>
>1. There was too much variation in the data to accurately predict a close election.
>
>2. The polls captured trends in the popular vote on the nation level, but not the state level. Small difference at the state level caused big difference in Electoral votes.
>
>3. The polls are responsive to current events, and did not capture critical events in the final days of the election. 
>
>4. The polls missed a sub-population and were biased (WARNING: This could be the most difficult to explore.)
>
>
>Your post-data assignment this week is to write up your findings from
>the election data from last week. You challenge is to present your
>findings in a way that does not alienate your audience. Try to allow
>your audience to follow along on the journey you took to come to your
>conclusion without being dry or boring.
>
>**Audience:** Generalist ("aware of the topic, but looking for an overview
>understanding and major themes") - you can assume the audience is more
>aware of this topic due to the intense media coverage over the last
>year.
>
>**Format:** A short write up in narrative style. Do not create a formal
>report, but should be more formal than the "data - journalism" piece
>last week.
>
>**Length:** maximum 4 pages double spaced (2 pages single spaced),
>including figures, excluding code.
>
>**Include code?** Always
>
>**Cite outside source:** not necessary, but could be helpful. If you do,
>make sure you cite the source.

## Overall goals

Since the students spent last week primarily concerned with the code
(and had lots of help), this week they should have focused more on the
narrative. They were tasked with analyzing the pre-election and
post-election data to find support for or against one of the
explanations above. They were specifically asked to focus on the data
rather than the politics. We talked about how to present this type of
analysis in a way that will not alienate the audience, some of whom
may have believed in the conclusion they are refuting. This should be
the focus of this assignment.

### Content

Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Summarizes the explanation they decided to address | 2
Determine if the explanation is supported, contradicted, or neither | 2
Supports conclusion with evidence from the data | 2
Included figures appropriate for a general audience\* | 2
Attempted to allow reader to "discover" main conclusions\*\* | 4
 | 
**Subtotal** | 12

\* Figures for this audience should still be accurate, but not
overly technical. Labels should be easy to understand, and confusing
plots (e.g., boxplots without explaining the elements) should be
avoided. Any aspect that is not easily grasped needs to be accompanied
by a brief explanation - the authors should not assume the audience
are experts. If figures were not used, the author needs to demonstrate
that the story is complete without them and that a general audience
would not be aided by including figures (very difficult). 

\*\* In class we discussed that allowing the audience to "discover"
the main conclusion by being lead through the evidence can be a
powerful communication tool. This works because rather than telling
the audience the conclusion and asking them to trust, you are showing
them evidence, and guiding them towards the conclusion - giving them
ownership and trust in the end result (hopefully). 

For this:

  * 2 pts if the student is "telling" rather than "showing" - relying
    too much on the reader putting faith in the author.
  * 3 pts for an attempt to lead the reader through the evidence, but
    the treatment is incomplete or difficult to follow
  * 4 pts for a well-done narrative in which the reader is guided to
    discover the relevant aspects of the data.

### Completeness

Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Includes code as Appendix | 2  
Within page limit (see prompt) | 2  
 | 
**Subtotal** | 4

### Style and tone

The prompt specifically indicated to write for a general (novice)
audience, though it can be assumed more knowledge than typical due to
the intense media coverage over the last year. 

Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Well-written, free of grammar and spelling errors | 2
Appropriate style for audience (not overly technical) | 2
 | 
**Subtotal** | 4
