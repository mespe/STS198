# Post-data #2 rubric
STS 198 Spring 2017


**Total points: 20**

### Completeness

Students were asked to model their report on the example report on
Canvas. Some deviation is OK, but the submission should be a "report"
style with a summary section, and all parts below should be included.

Section is included | Points
---- | ----:
Summary | 1
Objectives | 1
Findings/Evidence/Support | 1
Appendix/Code | 1
    | 
**Subtotal** | 4

### Content

To fully answer the prompt:

*Should they focus their efforts on certain airlines, or certain origin
cities? Or is the issue with certain times of day or days of the week?*

Students needed to address all four parts. If they claim that one part is
not worth investigating further, there should be some support or
evidence for that conclusion (e.g., "the mean
delay is roughly the same for all days of the week, so there is not a
single day of the week that is problematic."). 

The definition of the "worst" delay was intentionally left
vague - students could have chosen to look at reducing the maximum delay,
only delays over some threshold, or the average delay. Many different
ways of looking at these data is acceptable - the key is that
they put some thought into what they looked at.

If students completely neglected one aspect (as in failed to even
acknowledge it), they potentially lose points in both categories
below. 


Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Addresses/compares | 
  - airlines | 2
  - origin cities | 2
  - days of week | 2
  - time of day | 2

### Format

To effectively communicate results, the report needs to be presented
in a professional manner. Unprofessional reports discredit the hard
work done to analyze the data. 

Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Tone/style is appropriate for audience | 2
Prose is well-written and free of grammatical/spelling errors | 2
