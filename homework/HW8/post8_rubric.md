# Post-data 8 Rubric

*STS198 Spring 2017*

**Total points: 20**

### Prompt
>
>Airport delays revisited:
>
>Our first data set was the airline delay data for flights arriving in
>CA. You were asked specifically to look at flights arriving into the
>Sacramento airport, and recommend whether the airport administration
>should focus on:
>
>1. airlines
>
>2. origin cities
>
>3. days of week
>
>4. times of day
>
>This week, you will be working with nation-wide data, and looking for cases where your recommendation above is not a good one. Specifically, do your conclusions from Post-data #2 & 3 only hold for Sacramento, or only for CA airports. Is it valid to make conclusions for all airport delays after only looking at SMF? Or are delays into Sacramento so different from all other airports that doing so would be unwise?  
>
>Load the data:
>
>load(url("https://github.com/mespe/STS198/blob/master/data/airline_delay2016.rds?raw=true"))
> 
>
>Audience: Matt
>
>Format: Up to you
>
>Important considerations: Try to expand on the methods you used for
>Post-data #3. For that assignment, you knew very little R. Try to
>apply what you have learned since. Show off what you have learned this
>quarter.
>
>Grading criteria: A large piece of the grade for this assignment will
>reflect how creatively you address the challenge above. Copy code
>verbatim at your own risk. Feel free to play with the code you know
>and try new things.
>

## Overall goals

Since the students have already seen these data at the beginning of
the quarter, this assignment is an opportunity to apply what they have
learned since without the additional burden of learning a new data
set. A major aspect of this assignment is to see how they have
progressed in the last 6 weeks.
