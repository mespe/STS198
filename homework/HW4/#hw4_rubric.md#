# Post-data #4 Grading rubric

*STS198 Spring 2017*

**Total points: 20**

### Content

The prompt requested that the students write a short "data-journalism"
style piece that covered one interesting aspect of the data. We have
not covered how to write short pieces in class, so the grading will be
forgiving on some aspects related to how to tell a convincing story in
few words. 

Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Identified one interesting aspect | 2
Explored that aspect from multiple angles* | 4
Included figures appropriate for a general audience\*\* | 4
 | 
**Subtotal** | 10

\* Multiple angles could include (but not limited to) different
states, sub-populations, or types of accidents. 

\*\* Figures for this audience should still be accurate, but not
overly technical. Labels should be easy to understand, and confusing
plots (e.g., boxplots without explaining the elements) should be
avoided. Any aspect that is not easily grasped needs to be accompanied
by a brief explanation - the authors should not assume the audience
are experts. If figures were not used, the author needs to demonstrate
that the story is complete without them and that a general audience
would not be aided by including figures (very difficult). 

### Completeness

Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Includes code as Appendix | 2
Includes one reference to an outside source | 2
Within page limit (4 pg double spaced, including figs, excluding code) | 2
 | 
**Subtotal** | 6

### Style and tone

The prompt specifically indicated to write for a general (novice)
audience. 

Criteria | Points
---- | ----:
Well-written, free of grammar and spelling errors | 2
Appropriate style for audience (not overly technical) | 2
 | 
**Subtotal** | 4
